# UBER-case-study

OBJECTIVE –UberSupply & Demand Gap Analysis The objective is to identify the most probable reason behind the supply – Demand gap .
Our Aim is to help Uberto bridge the Gap between supply & Demand from City to Airport  & from Airport to City.  The Analysis comprises of basically four step: 
• Identify the frequency of the status of the request made, which is having three levels 1. “No cars available” 2. “Trip Completed” 3. “Cancelled”. 
• After identifying the most frequent status. Identify the type of request whether from Airport to city or City to Airport in which it showing the most problematic status. 
• Identify the Time slot of the day in which problem is at higher side. • Analyze from the plots the possible solution to the problem.

The problem of "No cars Available" from Airport to City can be rectified providing good incentive to the drivers which encourages them to work in night hours or to incentivize them for their idle timeinAirport.

# Conclusions
Incentivize the driver, price cut for passengers and carpooling could be the possible solutions to the nonavailability of car during early morning and late evening rush.
